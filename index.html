  <h1>Daniella Stokic</h1>
  <p><em>Junior Software Developer</em></p>
  <p id="aspirations">I'm currently attending Lehigh University as a computer science and business major and I plan to continue onto graduate school and get my master's degree in artificial intelligence. I really enjoy programming and learning new languages (both programming and otherwise) and love to work as part of a team to develop larger projects. I always try to have a side project going in order to keep my knowledge fresh and I am looking forward to being able to help in whatever way I can while learning new skills through various internships and opportunities.</p>

  <h2>My Current Programming Experience</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Preferred Programming Languages</summary>
    <p>Java: I learned Java as my first programming during a course called "Programming in Java" my sophomore year of high school. It remains my favorite programming language and it is what lead me to continue on with computer science.</p>
    <p>Python: I learned Python when I took AP Computer Science Principles my senior year of high school as it was the programming language I choose for my create performance task.</p>
    <p>HTML/CSS: I have learned HTML and CSS through various summer camps I took. One was the Drexel Digital Development Camp which I took the summer after junior year and the other was Kode with Klossy which I completed after senior year of high school</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Languages I Have Some Experience With</summary>
    <p>C: I learned a little bit of C when I took the HavardX course CS50, it was the language they taught the first half of the course. Its stance as a base language for many other languages make it so I want to try and learn similar, but more advanced, langauges like C++.</p>
    <p>Swift: I learned Swift because I chose the mobile development track as my final project for the CS50 course I took. I ended up developing a basic to-do list app called ZRoutine. I would like to do more Swift programming in the future for more advanced projects.</p>
    <p>SQL: I also learned a little bit of SQL when I took the HavardX course CS50, they taught about its uses regarding databases in a few lessons.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Languages I'm Currently Learning</summary>
    <p>JavaScript: I want to learn JavaScript because it is a widely used language that can be used for many different things. I also think that it would be useful because rarely is there a company that doesn't appreciate an employee who knows JavaScript.</p>
